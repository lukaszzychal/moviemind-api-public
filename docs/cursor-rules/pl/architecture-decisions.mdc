# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## 📋 When to create a new ADR?

**ALWAYS** create a new ADR in `docs/adr/` when:
1. **Making important architectural decision** - technology, framework, library choice
2. **Changing approach** - strategy, pattern, architecture change
3. **Resolving conflict** - choice between alternative solutions
4. **Documenting trade-off** - compromises and decision consequences
5. **Introducing new standard** - conventions, practices, rules

## 📁 Location

All ADRs are located in: `docs/adr/README.md`

## 📝 ADR Format

Each ADR should contain:

```markdown
## ADR-XXX: Decision Title

### 🇵🇱

**Status:** ✅ Accepted / ⏳ Proposed / ❌ Rejected  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Context:** Why the decision was made

### 🎯 Decision

Clear statement of the decision.

### 💡 Rationale

Detailed rationale:
- Advantages of chosen solution
- Disadvantages of rejected alternatives
- Consequences of decision

### 🔄 Consequences

- **Positive:** Benefits of decision
- **Negative:** Drawbacks and limitations

### 📊 Alternatives considered:

1. **Alternative 1** - why rejected
2. **Alternative 2** - why rejected
3. **Chosen solution** - chosen ✅

```

## 🔢 ADR Numbering

- **ADR-001, ADR-002, ...** - sequential numbers
- Check last number in `docs/adr/README.md`
- Use next available number

## 🔄 ADR Creation Workflow

1. **When making decision:**
   - If decision is important → create ADR
   - If choosing between alternatives → create ADR
   - If changing approach → create ADR

2. **Format:**
   - Add ADR to `docs/adr/README.md`
   - Add link in table of contents (PL and EN)
   - Use format from examples above

3. **After creation:**
   - Update table of contents in README.md
   - Add creation date
   - Set appropriate status

## ⚠️ Important Rules

1. **Don't skip ADRs** - important decisions must be documented
2. **Be honest** - document both advantages and disadvantages
3. **Document context** - explain why decision was made
4. **Update status** - change status if decision was changed
5. **Bilingual** - always add PL and EN versions

## 📌 Examples When to Create ADR

### ✅ Create ADR when:
- Choosing framework (Laravel vs Symfony) → ADR-001 ✅
- Choosing architecture (monolith vs microservices) → ADR-002 ✅
- Choosing strategy (dual-repo) → ADR-003 ✅
- Choosing approach (generation-first vs translate) → ADR-004 ✅
- Choosing Git workflow (Trunk Flow vs GitFlow) → ADR-005 ✅
- Choosing tool (Feature Flags) → ADR-006 ✅
- Choosing database (PostgreSQL vs MySQL)
- Choosing cache (Redis vs Memcached)
- Choosing queue system (Horizon vs RabbitMQ)

### ❌ Don't create ADR when:
- Decision is obvious and has no alternatives
- Decision is temporary (experiment)
- Decision concerns only one small task
- Decision has no impact on architecture
