# What NOT to do

## 🚫 List of prohibitions

1. ❌ Commit without tests
2. ❌ Ignore failing tests
3. ❌ Skip code quality tools (Pint, PHPStan, tests)
4. ❌ Commit secrets (always check GitLeaks)
5. ❌ Commit debug code (`dd()`, `dump()`, `var_dump()`)
6. ❌ Create too large commits (one commit = one logical change)
7. ❌ Apply principles forcefully (don't create excessive abstractions)
8. ❌ Ignore code smells (fix when they hinder work)
9. ❌ Create code without thinking about readability
10. ❌ Skip type hints and strict types

## Principle

If something is on the "NOT to do" list, it means it is **forbidden** and should not happen.
