# Pre-Commit Workflow (REQUIRED)

## 🌐 Language Convention (REQUIRED)

**All commit messages, PR titles, and PR descriptions MUST be in English.**

- ✅ **Commit messages:** Use English (e.g., `fix: resolve CI/CD test failures`)
- ✅ **PR titles:** Use English (e.g., `feat: Stage 3 - Movie metadata synchronization`)
- ✅ **PR descriptions:** Use English
- ❌ **NOT Polish:** Do not use Polish in commits or PRs

**Reason:** This is an open-source project and English is the standard language for international collaboration.

**Exception:** Internal documentation files (`docs/pl/`) can remain in Polish, but all Git-related content (commits, PRs, issues) must be in English.

## ⚠️ TDD BEFORE EVERYTHING

**BEFORE starting implementation:**

1. **Check if this is a new feature or change to existing functionality**
2. **If new feature:**
   - Write test first (RED)
   - Run test - it should FAIL
   - Write code (GREEN)
   - Run test - it should PASS
   - Refactor (REFACTOR)
3. **If changing existing functionality:**
   - Change tests first to expect new behavior (RED)
   - Run tests - they should FAIL
   - Change code (GREEN)
   - Run tests - they should PASS
   - Refactor (REFACTOR)

**NEVER write code before tests!**

## Automatic Git Hooks Installation

**BEFORE EVERY COMMIT OR PUSH - automatically check and install hooks:**

1. **Check if hooks are installed:**
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f ".git/hooks/pre-commit" ]; then
       if [ -f "scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit" ]; then
           cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
           chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
           echo "✅ Git hooks installed automatically"
       fi
   fi
   ```

2. **For AI Agent:**
   - Before every `git commit` or `git push`, automatically check if `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists
   - If it doesn't exist, automatically install from `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`
   - Make sure the hook has execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
   - **DO NOT ask user - execute automatically**

## Before every commit you MUST run and fix:

### 1. Markdownlint (Markdown formatting) - if .md files were changed
```bash
# Automatic fix (uses npx or npm scripts)
npm run markdownlint:fix
# Or for specific files
npx markdownlint-cli2-fix docs/issue/pl/TASKS.md

# Check
npm run markdownlint:check
```
**Installation:** `npm install` (markdownlint-cli2 is in package.json) or `./scripts/setup-markdownlint.sh`

### 2. Laravel Pint (PHP formatting)
```bash
cd api && vendor/bin/pint
```

### 3. PHPStan (static analysis)
```bash
cd api && vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G
```
Level: 5. Zero errors before commit.

#### PHPStan Auto-Fix (optional - uses internal command)
```bash
# Suggest mode (preview changes, default)
cd api && php artisan phpstan:auto-fix --mode=suggest

# Apply mode (saves changes to files)
cd api && php artisan phpstan:auto-fix --mode=apply

# Or use with existing JSON output from PHPStan
cd api && vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G --error-format=json > phpstan-output.json 2>&1 || true
cd api && php artisan phpstan:auto-fix --input=phpstan-output.json --mode=suggest
```

**Note:** Internal command `phpstan:auto-fix` uses module `App\Support\PhpstanFixer`. This is separate from external package `lukaszzychal/phpstan-fixer` (which was removed due to Laravel compatibility issues).

#### PHPStan Log Archiving
- After each PHPStan run, save full output (`stdout` + `stderr`) to log file.
- Use directory `docs/logs/phpstan/` (create on first use, e.g., `mkdir -p docs/logs/phpstan`).
- File name: `phpstan-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` (e.g., `phpstan-20251109-153000.log`).
- Recommended command:
```bash
cd api && vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G 2>&1 | tee ../docs/logs/phpstan/phpstan-$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S").log
```
- Do not delete existing log files — they will be needed in future projects.

### 3. PHPUnit (tests)
```bash
cd api && php artisan test
```
All tests must pass.

### 4. Markdownlint (Markdown formatting) - **AUTOMATICALLY IN PRE-COMMIT HOOK**

Pre-commit hook automatically runs markdownlint-cli2-fix for .md files before commit.

### 5. GitLeaks (secrets) - **REQUIRED BEFORE COMMIT AND PUSH**
```bash
gitleaks protect --source . --verbose --no-banner
```
Zero detected secrets.

**IMPORTANT:** Before every commit and push **ALWAYS** run GitLeaks. If GitLeaks is not installed, install it:
```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks

# Or use installation script
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh
```

**Automatic hook installation:**
- If hooks are not installed, automatically install them from `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`
- Check if `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists, if not - copy from `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`
- Make sure the hook has execute permissions: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### 6. Composer Audit (security)
```bash
cd api && composer audit
```
Fix critical vulnerabilities before commit.

### 6. API Documentation Update (if endpoints were changed)
**IMPORTANT:** If endpoints were added/changed/removed, **ALWAYS** update:

#### OpenAPI Spec
```bash
# Update docs/openapi.yaml
# Add/change/remove endpoints according to code changes
```

#### Postman Collection
```bash
# Update docs/postman/moviemind-api.postman_collection.json
# Add/change/remove requests according to API changes
```

#### Insomnia Collection
```bash
# Update docs/insomnia/moviemind-api-insomnia.json
# Add/change/remove requests according to API changes
```

**When to update:**
- ✅ New endpoint added
- ✅ Endpoint path changed
- ✅ Request/response parameters changed
- ✅ Endpoint removed
- ✅ Status codes changed
- ✅ Authorization added/changed

**Update format:**
- OpenAPI: According to OpenAPI 3.0 format
- Postman: JSON format compatible with Postman Collection v2.1
- Insomnia: JSON format compatible with Insomnia Export

### 7. Manual Testing Instructions Update (if testing mechanisms were changed)
**IMPORTANT:** If testing mechanisms, endpoints, feature flags, response format, or log structure were changed, **ALWAYS** update:

#### Manual Testing Guide
```bash
# Update docs/knowledge/reference/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md (PL)
# Update docs/knowledge/reference/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.en.md (EN)
```

**When to update:**
- ✅ API endpoints changed (added/changed/removed)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention mechanisms changed (e.g., slot management, locking)
- ✅ Feature flags changed (added/changed/removed)
- ✅ API response format changed
- ✅ Slug format requirements changed
- ✅ Log structure changed (e.g., new logs, format change)
- ✅ Feature flag activation method changed
- ✅ New test scenarios added

**Update format:**
- Update relevant test sections
- Update command examples
- Update troubleshooting
- Update final checklist
- Update "Last updated" date

## Complete check (everything at once)

```bash
# Markdown formatting (if .md files changed, optional - pre-commit hook does this automatically)
npm run markdownlint:fix && \
cd api && \
  vendor/bin/pint && \
  vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G && \
  php artisan test && \
  cd .. && \
  gitleaks protect --source . --verbose --no-banner && \
  cd api && \
  composer audit
```

**Note:** Pre-commit hook automatically runs markdownlint for .md files, so manual run is optional.

**Remember:** After API changes always update documentation (OpenAPI, Postman, Insomnia) and manual testing instructions!

## Automatic Git Hooks Installation

**Before every commit or push:**
1. Check if `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists
2. If it doesn't exist, automatically install from `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```
3. Check if GitLeaks is installed (`command -v gitleaks`)
4. If not, inform user about installation requirement (don't block, but warn)

**Automatic secret verification:**
- Before every commit: run `gitleaks protect --source . --verbose --no-banner --staged`
- Before every push: run `gitleaks protect --source . --verbose --no-banner`
- If secrets are detected, **BLOCK** commit/push and inform user

## Branch Workflow (default rule)

- **90% of tasks** should be implemented on short feature branches (`feature/…`) covering one coherent topic.
- Each branch should end with a pull request to `main` (you can approve yourself, but PR and diff are mandatory).
- `main` must remain always deployable; merge only after tests/pre-commits pass.
- Longer, multi-week branches should be used only in exceptional reconstructions — then divide work into smaller PRs.
- **Commit messages** must be in English only, in style `type: short description` (e.g., `feat: add movie resource`). Messages in other languages are not allowed.
- **Pull Request descriptions** (body) must be in English only. All PR descriptions, titles, and sections must be in English. PR descriptions in other languages are not allowed.
- Agent can execute `git commit`, but `git push` runs only on explicit user command.

## Immediate commits

- After each change in Cursor rule files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) immediately commit these files.
- After adding a new task or updating existing task content in `docs/issue/**/*.md`, immediately commit these changes in a separate commit.

## Task Management (TASKS.md)

- After starting a task **change status to `🔄 IN_PROGRESS`**, enter `Start time` (with minute precision) and mark executor (`🤖/👨‍💻/⚙️`).
- After completing a task:
  - fill in `End time` and **calculate `Duration`** (format `HHhMMm`), even when shortcut says AUTO,
  - change status to `✅ COMPLETED`,
  - **move entire task block to "✅ Completed Tasks" section**,
  - add short description of work done (e.g., list of key changes).
- Do not leave completed tasks in "Active" section. This section should contain only tasks with status `⏳` or `🔄`.
- After updating `TASKS.md` trigger sync workflow (push/merge to `main` or manually in GitHub Actions) to keep Issues consistent.

## Documentation (PL / EN)

- Each document must have Polish and English versions (e.g., in `docs/…/pl` and `docs/…/en`).
- When modifying one language **immediately** update the other — lack of synchronization is treated as a review error.
- If content is long, summaries are acceptable, but both languages must contain complete key information and link to each other.
- Index files (e.g., `docs/issue/README.md`) should clearly indicate where PL and EN versions are located.

## External links and proper nouns

- When providing publicly available proper nouns (e.g., online stores, providers) **always** include a reliable URL link next to it.
- Each external link **must be verified** (open/test check) to ensure it's active and leads to the correct source.
- If you cannot confirm a link, **clearly mark it**, adding an alternative source or warning.
- Format responses clearly (headers, bullet lists) according to Cursor guidelines.

## Manual testing

- **ALWAYS** manually test tasks and functions that can be tested without automated tests.
- **Inform continuously** about testing steps and results:
  - Describe each testing step (e.g., "Testing endpoint GET /api/v1/movies/{slug}")
  - Provide results of each test (success/error, status code, response time, etc.)
  - Inform about encountered problems or unexpected behaviors
  - Report testing progress (e.g., "Tested 3/5 scenarios")
- Before completing a task, verify that implementation works correctly in practice (e.g., by calling API endpoint, checking response, verifying behavior in browser).
- If testing requires Docker or other tool (e.g., Redis, Horizon, PostgreSQL), **always inform user**:
  - What tool is needed
  - How to run it (e.g., `docker compose up -d`, `php artisan horizon`)
  - What commands to execute for verification
  - Where to check results (logs, dashboard, etc.)
- Examples of situations requiring manual testing:
  - New API endpoints (checking response, status codes, JSON format)
  - Integrations with external services (OpenAI, etc.)
  - UI/UX changes (if applicable)
  - Features requiring user interaction
  - Scenarios difficult to test automatically (e.g., race conditions, timing issues)
- If manual testing is not possible or would require too much time, inform user about this and propose alternative approach (e.g., automated tests, documentation, etc.).

## Informing about AI model and tokens

- **ALWAYS** inform user which AI model you're using at the beginning of response or when it's relevant to context.
- Format: `**AI Model Used:** [model name]` (e.g., `Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Auto)`, `OpenAI gpt-4o-mini`).
- If token information (used/remaining) is available and **providing it doesn't consume additional tokens**, you can include it:
  - Basic format: `**Tokens:** used: X, remaining: Y` (or similar, depending on available data).
  - If detailed token information for prompt/response or input/output is available, you can provide it:
    - Format: `**Tokens:** input: X, output: Y, total: Z` or `**Tokens:** prompt: X, response: Y, total: Z`
    - Include only information that is available and providing it doesn't consume additional tokens.
- If token information is not available or providing it would consume additional tokens, omit this information.
- In context of MovieMind API application, if you mention model used by application (e.g., OpenAI), always provide full model name (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).
