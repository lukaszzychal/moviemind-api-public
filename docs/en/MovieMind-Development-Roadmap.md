## Project Goal

MovieMind API is an intelligent API that generates and stores unique descriptions, biographies, and data about movies, series, and actors using AI models.

### Key Objectives
- Content Uniqueness — every description generated from scratch by AI
- Multilingual Support — intelligent translation across multiple languages
- Versioning — comparison and selection of best description versions
- Scalability — hybrid Python + PHP architecture
- Monetization — API-as-a-Service through RapidAPI

### Dual-Repository Strategy
- Public repo — portfolio, skills demonstration
- Private repo — full commercial product with AI, billing, webhooks

---

## Laravel Architecture

### System Components

| Component      | Technology   | Role               | Port |
| ---------------| ------------ | ------------------ | ---- |
| Laravel API    | PHP 8.3+     | Public API + Admin | 8000 |
| PostgreSQL     | 15+          | Database           | 5432 |
| Redis          | 7+           | Cache              | 6379 |
| Horizon        | Laravel Queue| Async task queue   | 8001 |
| OpenAI API     | External     | AI content gen     | -    |

### Data Flow
```
Client → Laravel API → Redis Cache → PostgreSQL
                              ↓
                         OpenAI API (async job)
                              ↓
                         PostgreSQL → Redis → Client
```

### Laravel Architecture Benefits
- Simplicity — single framework for API and admin
- Development speed — Laravel has everything out-of-the-box
- Async processing — Laravel Horizon for AI tasks
- Scalability — Horizon scale workers independently
- Cost — cheaper infrastructure and maintenance
- Developer experience — easier debugging of single stack

### Public edge evolution (optional future)
If you ever need:
- RapidAPI deployment → Place an API Gateway (Kong, Tyk) in front of Laravel
- High scale (>10k req/min) → Scale Laravel horizontally (Octane, Redis caching)
- Python team → Let them integrate via queue/SDK without owning a separate API

---

## Multilingual Support

### i18n/l10n Strategy

#### General Principles
- Canonical language — en-US as source of truth
- Generation-first — descriptions generated from scratch in target language
- Translate-then-adapt — short summaries translated and adapted
- Glossary system — dictionary of non-translatable terms

#### Supported Languages
1. Polish (pl-PL)
2. English (en-US)
3. German (de-DE)
4. French (fr-FR)
5. Spanish (es-ES)

### Multilingual Data Schema
```sql
-- Main tables
movies(id, source_of_truth_locale, ...)
people(id, source_of_truth_locale, ...)

-- Localization variants
movie_locales(id, movie_id, locale, title_localized, tagline, ...)
person_locales(id, person_id, locale, name_localized, aliases[], ...)

-- Generated/translated content
movie_descriptions(id, movie_id, locale, text, context_tag, origin, ...)
person_bios(id, person_id, locale, text, context_tag, origin, ...)

-- Glossary
glossary_terms(id, term, locale, policy, notes, examples[])
```

- Value-based pricing
- Freemium model
- Enterprise sales

---

## Git Trunk Flow

### Code Management Strategy
We use **Git Trunk Flow** as the primary code management strategy for MovieMind API with a single always-releasable branch.

### Trunk Flow Advantages
- Single source of truth — we work exclusively on `main`
- Fast iterations — small changes land on `main` the same day
- Continuous quality — run tests and linters before every push
- Feature flags — control feature exposure without branches
- Simple rollback — `git revert` or flag toggle
- Lower integration cost — no long-lived branches

### Trunk Flow Workflow
1. Sync with `main` — `git pull --rebase origin main`
2. Small change set — implement in one or few commits (optionally behind a flag)
3. Local validation — Pint, PHPStan, PHPUnit, GitLeaks, Composer audit
4. Fast review — short PR targeting `main` (no protection blocking merge after approval)
5. Merge/push to `main` — same day, avoid batching changes
6. Observability — monitor deploy; use `revert` or disable flag if needed

### Practices That Support Trunk Flow
- Feature flags to hide incomplete features
- Toggle routing/feature configuration via `.env`/database instead of branches
- Pair or async review with max 2h response time
- Automated CI/CD pipelines on every push to `main`

---

## Feature Flags

### Feature Control Strategy
We use official Laravel Feature Flags integration (`laravel/feature-flags`) instead of custom implementation.

### Official Laravel integration advantages
- Official support
- Simplicity
- Security
- Integration
- Features out-of-the-box
- Maintenance by Laravel team

### Feature Flag Types
1. Boolean flags — enable/disable features
2. Percentage flags — gradual rollout (0-100%)
3. User-based flags — for specific users
4. Environment flags — different settings per environment

### Feature Flags Configuration (example)
```php
<?php
return [
    'ai_description_generation' => true,
    'gpt4_generation' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'percentage' => 25 // 25% of users
    ],
    'multilingual_support' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'percentage' => 50 // 50% of users
    ],
    'style_packs' => false // Disabled
];
```

- Week 8 — Observability toolkit solidified
- Week 10 — Commercial handoff package (optional: expose Laravel via API Gateway)

---

## Summary

MovieMind API is an ambitious project combining best practices of Laravel architecture with advanced AI capabilities. Through the dual-repository strategy, we build both a portfolio and a commercial product. The Laravel-only architecture simplifies the MVP and can evolve to hybrid when needed.

---

## Architecture Evolution

### Evolutionary Strategy

Phase 1 (MVP): Everything in Laravel — Current
- Single framework = faster development
- Simpler maintenance and debugging
- Cheaper infrastructure
- Laravel Horizon for async jobs

Phase 2 (optional, if needed): Harden the public edge
- RapidAPI deployment → Add an API Gateway (Kong/Tyk) in front of Laravel
- High scale (>10k req/min) → Scale Laravel horizontally (Octane, cache, read replicas)
- Python team → Integrate via queues (RabbitMQ) or SDK instead of a separate API

When to split?
- Publishing API on RapidAPI
- >10k requests/minute
- Need advanced Python AI pipelines
- Have separate Python team
