## Project Goal

MovieMind API is an intelligent API that generates and stores unique descriptions, biographies, and data about movies, series, and actors using AI models.

### Key Objectives
- Content Uniqueness â€” every description generated from scratch by AI
- Multilingual Support â€” intelligent translation across multiple languages
- Versioning â€” comparison and selection of best description versions
- Scalability â€” hybrid Python + PHP architecture
- Monetization â€” API-as-a-Service through RapidAPI

### Dual-Repository Strategy
- Public repo â€” portfolio, skills demonstration
- Private repo â€” full commercial product with AI, billing, webhooks

---

## MVP - Public Repository

## Laravel Architecture

### System Components

| Component      | Technology   | Role               | Port |
| ---------------| ------------ | ------------------ | ---- |
| Laravel API    | PHP 8.3+     | Public API + Admin | 8000 |
| PostgreSQL     | 15+          | Database           | 5432 |

| OpenAI API     | External     | AI content gen     | -    |

### Data Flow
```
Client â†’ Laravel API â†’ Redis Cache â†’ PostgreSQL
                              â†“
                         OpenAI API (async job)
                              â†“
                         PostgreSQL â†’ Redis â†’ Client
```

### Laravel Architecture Benefits
- Simplicity â€” single framework for API and admin
- Development speed â€” Laravel has everything out-of-the-box
- Async processing â€” Laravel Horizon for AI tasks
- Scalability â€” Horizon scale workers independently
- Cost â€” cheaper infrastructure and maintenance
- Developer experience â€” easier debugging of single stack

### Evolution to Hybrid (optional future)
If you ever need:

- High scale (>10k req/min) â†’ Extract public API
- Python team â†’ Give them FastAPI, you control Laravel admin

---

## Multilingual Support

### i18n/l10n Strategy

#### General Principles
- Canonical language â€” en-US as source of truth
- Generation-first â€” descriptions generated from scratch in target language
- Translate-then-adapt â€” short summaries translated and adapted
- Glossary system â€” dictionary of non-translatable terms

#### Supported Languages
1. Polish (pl-PL)
2. English (en-US)
3. German (de-DE)
4. French (fr-FR)
5. Spanish (es-ES)

### Multilingual Data Schema
```sql
-- Main tables
movies(id, source_of_truth_locale, ...)
people(id, source_of_truth_locale, ...)

-- Localization variants
movie_locales(id, movie_id, locale, title_localized, tagline, ...)
person_locales(id, person_id, locale, name_localized, aliases[], ...)

-- Generated/translated content
movie_descriptions(id, movie_id, locale, text, context_tag, origin, ...)
person_bios(id, person_id, locale, text, context_tag, origin, ...)

-- Glossary
glossary_terms(id, term, locale, policy, notes, examples[])
```

## Monetization

### RapidAPI Plans

| Plan           | Limit                 | Price      | Features                   |
| ------         | -------               | -------    | ----------                 |
| Free           | 100 requests/month    | $0         | Basic data, cache          |
| Pro            | 10,000 requests/month | $29/month  | AI generation, style packs |
| Enterprise     | Unlimited             | $199/month | Webhooks, dedicated models |

### Billing Model
- Pay-per-use â€” usage-based payment
- Subscription â€” monthly subscription
- Enterprise â€” corporate license
- Webhook billing â€” webhook-based billing

### Pricing Strategy
- Competitive pricing
- Value-based pricing
- Freemium model
- Enterprise sales

---

## Git Trunk Flow

### Code Management Strategy
We use Git Trunk Flow as the main code management strategy for MovieMind API.

### Trunk Flow Advantages
- Simpler workflow â€” single main branch (main)
- Faster integrations â€” frequent merging to main
- Fewer conflicts â€” shorter feature branch lifetime
- Better CI/CD â€” every commit on main can be deployed
- Feature flags â€” feature control without branches
- Rollback â€” easy rollback through feature flags

### Workflow
1. Feature branch â€” `feature/ai-description-generation`
2. Pull Request â€” code review and tests
3. Merge to main â€” after approval
4. Deploy â€” automatic deploy with feature flags
5. Feature flag â€” feature enablement control

---

## Feature Flags

### Feature Control Strategy
We use official Laravel Feature Flags integration (`laravel/feature-flags`) instead of custom implementation.

### Official Laravel integration advantages
- Official support
- Simplicity
- Security
- Integration
- Features out-of-the-box
- Maintenance by Laravel team

### Feature Flag Types
1. Boolean flags â€” enable/disable features
2. Percentage flags â€” gradual rollout (0-100%)
3. User-based flags â€” for specific users
4. Environment flags â€” different settings per environment

### Feature Flags Configuration (example)
```php
<?php
return [
    'ai_description_generation' => true,
    'gpt4_generation' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'percentage' => 25 // 25% of users
    ],
    'multilingual_support' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'percentage' => 50 // 50% of users
    ],
    'style_packs' => false // Disabled
];
```

## Summary

MovieMind API is an ambitious project combining best practices of Laravel architecture with advanced AI capabilities. Through the dual-repository strategy, we build both a portfolio and a commercial product. The Laravel-only architecture simplifies the MVP and can evolve to hybrid when needed.

---

## Architecture Evolution

### Evolutionary Strategy

Phase 1 (MVP): Everything in Laravel â€” Current
- Single framework = faster development
- Simpler maintenance and debugging
- Cheaper infrastructure
- Laravel Horizon for async jobs

Phase 2 (optional, if needed): Extract Public API
- RapidAPI deployment â†’ Add FastAPI as reverse proxy
- High scale (>10k req/min) â†’ Extract public API to FastAPI
- Python team â†’ Give them FastAPI, you control Laravel admin

When to split?
- Publishing API on RapidAPI
- >10k requests/minute
- Need advanced Python AI pipelines
- Have separate Python team
