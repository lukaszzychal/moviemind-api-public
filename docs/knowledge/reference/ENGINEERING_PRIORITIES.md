## 🎯 Priority Hierarchy

In case of conflicts, priorities are as follows:

1. **Security** - secrets, security vulnerabilities (highest priority)
2. **Tests** - all tests must pass, TDD
3. **Code quality** - PHPStan, Pint (required before commit)
4. **Readability** - code must be understandable (required)
5. **Best practices** - SOLID, DRY, GRASP, CUPID (apply pragmatically)

## Principle

**Security > Tests > Quality > Readability > Practices**
