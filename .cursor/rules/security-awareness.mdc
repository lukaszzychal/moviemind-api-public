# Security Awareness and Practices

## Principle

**Security is the highest priority. Always consider security implications during development, code review, and task execution.**

## Security-First Mindset

### During Development

1. **Always consider security:**
   - Before writing code, think about security implications
   - Security by design, not as an afterthought
   - Defense in depth - multiple layers of protection
   - Fail secure - safe default behaviors

2. **Security during task execution:**
   - ✅ **Minor security issues** - fix immediately as part of current task
   - ✅ **Medium security issues** - add to current task if time permits
   - ✅ **Major security issues** - create separate high-priority task immediately

3. **Security code review checklist:**
   - [ ] Input validation and sanitization
   - [ ] Output encoding/escaping
   - [ ] Authentication and authorization verified
   - [ ] Error handling without information leaks
   - [ ] Logging without secrets
   - [ ] Dependencies updated
   - [ ] Secrets only in environment variables
   - [ ] Prompt injection protection (for AI features)
   - [ ] SQL injection protection (ORM used)
   - [ ] XSS protection (if applicable)

## Security Standards

### OWASP Top 10

Always consider OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection (SQL, Command, LDAP, Prompt Injection)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### OWASP LLM Top 10 (for AI features)

Always consider OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities:
1. Prompt Injection
2. Insecure Output Handling
3. Training Data Poisoning
4. Model Denial of Service
5. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
6. Sensitive Information Disclosure
7. Insecure Plugin Design
8. Excessive Agency
9. Overreliance
10. Model Theft

## Security Audits

### Ad-hoc Security Reviews

**When:** During code review or when implementing new features

**Process:**
1. Review code for security issues
2. Check security checklist
3. Verify security controls implementation
4. Document findings
5. Fix minor issues immediately
6. Create tasks for major issues

**Scope:**
- Quick security review
- Security checklist verification
- Best practices check

### Comprehensive Security Audits

**Frequency:**
- **Quarterly** (every 3 months) - basic audits
- **Semi-annually** (every 6 months) - detailed audits
- **Before major releases** - pre-release audits
- **After security incidents** - post-incident audits

**Scope:**
1. OWASP Top 10 review
2. OWASP LLM Top 10 review (for AI features)
3. Dependency audit
4. Configuration review
5. Code security review (SAST)
6. Infrastructure security
7. Authentication & Authorization
8. Data protection
9. Logging & Monitoring
10. Incident response procedures

**Process:**
1. **Planning** (1-2 days before)
   - Define scope
   - Prepare checklist
   - Schedule time

2. **Execution** (1-3 days)
   - Conduct audit
   - Document findings
   - Prioritize issues

3. **Reporting** (1 day after)
   - Create report
   - Categorize issues
   - Provide recommendations

4. **Remediation** (1-4 weeks)
   - Implement fixes
   - Verify fixes
   - Follow-up review

### Security Audit Template

When conducting comprehensive audits, use the following template:

```markdown
# Security Audit Report - YYYY-MM-DD

## Executive Summary
- Audit Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Scope: [Comprehensive/Partial]
- Issues Found: X (Critical: Y, High: Z, Medium: W, Low: V)

## Findings

### Critical (P0)
- [Issue 1]
  - Description
  - Risk
  - Recommendation
  - Status

### High (P1)
- [Issue 2]
  ...

## OWASP Top 10 Mapping
- A01: ✅/⚠️/❌
- ...

## OWASP LLM Top 10 Mapping
- LLM01: ✅/⚠️/❌
- ...

## Recommendations
1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]

## Action Items
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
```

## Security Issue Prioritization

### Priority Levels

1. **🔴 Critical (P0)** - Fix immediately, blocks deployment
   - Active exploits
   - Data breaches
   - System compromise
   - Critical vulnerabilities

2. **🟡 High (P1)** - Fix before next release
   - High-risk vulnerabilities
   - Security misconfigurations
   - Missing security controls

3. **🟢 Medium (P2)** - Fix in next sprint
   - Medium-risk vulnerabilities
   - Best practice violations
   - Minor security improvements

4. **⚪ Low (P3)** - Fix when time permits
   - Low-risk issues
   - Informational findings
   - Enhancement opportunities

### Handling Security Issues

**During task execution:**
- ✅ **Minor issues** - fix immediately as part of current task
- ✅ **Medium issues** - add to current task if time permits
- ✅ **Major issues** - create separate high-priority task immediately

**After security audit:**
- Create tasks for all findings
- Prioritize based on risk level
- Track remediation progress
- Verify fixes

## Security Tools and Automation

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management

**Never:**
- ❌ Hardcode secrets in code
- ❌ Commit secrets to repository
- ❌ Log secrets
- ❌ Expose secrets in error messages

**Always:**
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Use secret management systems
- ✅ Verify with GitLeaks before commit
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly

### Input Validation

**Always:**
- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Sanitize user input
- ✅ Check length limits
- ✅ Verify data types
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (ORM)

### Error Handling

**Security considerations:**
- ✅ Generic error messages for users
- ✅ Detailed errors only in logs (development)
- ✅ No stack traces in production
- ✅ No file paths in errors
- ✅ No sensitive data in errors

### Logging

**Security logging:**
- ✅ Log all security events
- ✅ Never log secrets
- ✅ Use structured logging
- ✅ Implement log rotation
- ✅ Monitor security logs

### AI Security (Prompt Injection)

**For AI features:**
- ✅ Sanitize all inputs used in prompts
- ✅ Detect suspicious patterns
