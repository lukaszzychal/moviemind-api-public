# Task Management System

## ⭐ ALWAYS START FROM `docs/issue/TASKS.md`

Before starting work:

1. Read `docs/issue/TASKS.md` - find a task with status `⏳ PENDING`
2. Change status to `🔄 IN_PROGRESS`
3. Read task details (if there's a link)
4. Execute the task according to the description
5. After completion: change status to `✅ COMPLETED`, move to "Completed" section

## Task system structure

- **`docs/issue/TASKS.md`** - main task backlog (always start from this)
- **`docs/issue/README.md`** - system usage instructions
- **`docs/issue/TASK_TEMPLATE.md`** - template for new tasks
- **`docs/issue/*.md`** - detailed task descriptions (if available)

## Task priorities

- 🔴 **High** - critical, execute as soon as possible
- 🟡 **Medium** - important, but not critical
- 🟢 **Low** - can be done later (often roadmap items)

## Prioritization function (for AI)

1. Always analyze all `⏳ PENDING` tasks, collecting: priority, dependencies, blocking risks, and required resources.
2. First plan 🔴 tasks (stability, security), then 🟡, finally 🟢.
3. Promote tasks that unblock others or are thematically related (e.g. CI, security) – minimize context switching.
4. Report result as an ordered list with a brief justification "why" for each point.
5. When user asks for order, apply the above steps and present recommendation as a list.
