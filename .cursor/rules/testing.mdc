# Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Basic principle

**Always write tests before implementation. Red-Green-Refactor cycle.**

## TDD Cycle

1. **RED** - Write a test that defines expected behavior
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code needed to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code while keeping tests passing

## ✅ Always

- Write tests before code - test first, then implementation
- Run `php artisan test` after each change
- New code requires tests
- Feature Tests for API endpoints
- Unit Tests for business logic

## ❌ NEVER

- Don't commit code without tests
- Don't skip tests "because it's a small change"
- Don't ignore failing tests
- **Don't write implementation code before writing tests** - this violates TDD principle

## Test types

- **Feature Tests** (`tests/Feature/`) - API endpoints and integration
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/`) - Business logic and services
