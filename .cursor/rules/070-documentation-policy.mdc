# Documentation policy (ADR + Knowledge Base)

Create ADR only for important architectural decisions with real trade-offs:
- technology choice
- major pattern/strategy change
- contract changes with consequences

Create Knowledge docs for:
- reusable solutions
- non-trivial debugging findings
- technical analyses needed later

Do not create documentation for trivial tasks.
When creating docs: keep them short, follow the project template, and link the related task.
