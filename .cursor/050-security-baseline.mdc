# Security baseline

- Never add/commit secrets. Prefer environment variables. Never log secrets.
- Validate input, enforce auth/authorization, and consider rate limiting for public endpoints.
- If output/logs may contain sensitive data: stop and warn.
- For AI-related features: treat user input as untrusted (prompt injection). Keep strict output formats.
