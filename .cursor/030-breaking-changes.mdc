# Breaking changes: stop and analyze

If a change may affect DB schema/data, API contracts, identifiers/slugs, validation rules, or existing behavior:
STOP and provide:
1) what breaks (exactly)
2) affected endpoints/data
3) safe plan: backward compatibility, migration steps, rollout, rollback
4) tests covering existing data/clients
Only then implement.
